/* Ex #4a1: get message with two numbers and find the GCD of the two numbers

 * Input: Nothing.
 * Output: Nothing.
 *
 */

/* Ex #4a2: get message with number and find factor primes
 * Input: Nothing.
 * Output: Nothing.
 *
 */

/* Ex #4a3: get message with number and find factor primes
 * Input: using argument.
 * Output: if argv[1]=0 the output is gcd number.
 *         if argv[1]=1 the output is primes factor of number.
 * Example: (in terminal) we have to run the servers first,
 * 			then ./ex4b3 0 12 14
 * Output : 2

/* Ex #4b3:  the client of two servers that find gcd or factor primes using
 * private servers(using fifo files )
 * Input: using argument.
 * Output: if argv[1]=0 the output is gcd number.
 *         if argv[1]=1 the output is primes factor of number.
 * Example: (in terminal) we have to run the servers first

/* Ex #4c: make two sons then give array of random numbers between 0-100 to
 * the two sons and send from the parent random number then check if the number
 * is found in arrays , and find which array get covered first ,
 * print the array then send to stop the lose son .
 *
 * Input: Nothing.
 * Output: Array of the child who wins
